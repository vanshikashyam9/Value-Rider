## Project Overview

Value Rider aims to assist car owners in estimating the market value of their used cars based on various attributes such as make, model, condition, mileage, and more. By inputting their car's details into the application, users receive an estimated selling price, helping them make informed decisions when selling their vehicle.

The project involves:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing a dataset of used cars for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Building and training a neural network to predict car prices.
- **Web Application**: Developing a user interface for users to input car details and view price predictions.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface for inputting car details.
- **Accurate Predictions**: Utilizes a neural network model trained on a comprehensive dataset.
- **Real-Time Results**: Provides instant price estimates upon form submission.
- **Extensive Vehicle Attributes**: Considers various factors like manufacturer, condition, fuel type, transmission, and more.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular codebase allowing for easy updates and maintenance.
